These scripts are part of the OpenAlex [snapshot documentation](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot). 

The scripts are not working correctly due to changes in the OpenAlex schema. Sorry about that! We plan to update them in the future. 

In the meantime we suggest using the scripts as a starting point, and modifying them as needed. We will happily accept pull 
requests if you are feeling generous!
