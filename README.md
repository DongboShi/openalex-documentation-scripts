These scripts are part of the OpenAlex [snapshot documentation](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot).

They are intended as a starting point for flattening the snapshot and loading it into a relational database. We try 
to keep these up to date with the latest snapshot, but we can't guarantee it. 

We will happily accept pull requests if you are feeling generous!
